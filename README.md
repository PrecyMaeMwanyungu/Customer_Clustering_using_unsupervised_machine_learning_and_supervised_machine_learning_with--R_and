##  TITLE
 Supervised machine learning and customer clustering using unsupervised machine learning on R programming language

## AUTHOR
 * Precy Mae Mwanyungu

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project has two parts:


1. Part one performs supervised learning on a project done previously in order to predict whether or not a website visitor will click on advertisement using R programming.

2. Part two performs unsupervised learning for a Russian company, Kira Palistinina, which is trying to understand their customer behaviour. In order to best achieve that, we will perform hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering, compare the two and draw insights from them using R programming.
